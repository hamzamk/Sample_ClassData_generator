# Project description
Generate student score data for quiz and assignments with the intention of testing various data visualization techniques. The data is generated using beta distribution and with one assumption(s) that the scores are between 0 - 100 and the avearge time spent on each quiz(and time of submisstion) by a student is random(as sampled from a normal distribution).   

# Installation Requirements
I highly recommend anaconda virtual environment for this, or any python project, since anaconda automatically configures the correct(conflict free) version numbers for python libraries.


1. random 
2. urllib
