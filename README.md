# Project description
Generate student score data for quiz and assignments with the intention of testing various data visualization techniques. The data is generated using beta distribution and with one assumption(s) that the scores are between 0 - 100 and the avearge time spent on each quiz(and time of submisstion) by a student is random(as sampled from a normal distribution).   

# Installation Requirements

1. random 
2. urllib
